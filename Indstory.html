    <p>In Singapore, the sunsets burn orange-gold; the sky is lit up in flames, in the roars of lions, paintbrush public housing dipped in liquid fire. In Singapore, the sky is a peek-a-boo and its
    fingers the skyscrapers, the multi-storied buildings that litter the land of my childhood. In Singapore, the sky is small; in Singapore, your eye runs its touch along concrete spines and spires to end in the navel of the sky, the dip of eternity, so close you could almost be
    claustrophobic.</p>
    <p>In Boston, when I first came three years ago, no one understood me for the first week. My words felt heavy, felt drowned with an accent that only I could understand, and the sun-kissed sea of home suddenly felt like being dragged onto land, trying to figure out how to breathe. Now, I no longer feel like I’m drowning; instead, I am a ghost, reduced to a figure, my words present but insubstantial.</p>
    <p>Being international on this campus mostly feels like not being. It feels like not being in that someone once told me to learn about global white supremacy by taking race in america; it feels like not being in that someone told me I was in Boston now, I had to support the Patriots and watch “football”. That when I expressed my frustration that we don’t talk about
    international issues on campus, someone told me, “we’re an American campus and should focus on America”; that someone once asked why I was making recommendations at a Singaporean restaurant.</p>
    <p>Once, when talking about being Chinese, someone looked me straight in the eye and told me that I was Singaporean, not Chinese, as if I had gotten things mixed up. Once, when talking about life in Singapore, someone leaned over and told me that Singapore wasn’t a real place, that the real world didn’t work that way. Once, when a friend asked if I preferred America over home, she took a second’s hesitation as a signal to speak for me, to say of course I preferred this country to home. Once, or a few times, or over and over and over, my voice, my identity, my history, has been eroded on this campus, its particularities obliviated like the daffodil buds in a Boston snowstorm.</p>
    <p>Boston and Tufts, I do love you. I love you in the way the sunsets here shift from day to day; I love you the way the sky is sometimes suffused with blue or pink, and our campus glows from beneath. I love you the way the darker sky is sometimes ringed with light, pastel halo horizons; I love you the way that my room back home is now painted the colour of a summer sky, the kind of intense blue I first saw walking here.</p>
    <p>I love you in the way that I have been changed by being here; but Tufts, for all my love, how have you been changed by me being here? When I came to college, I expected to be changed, to grow into a better version of myself; but what has my Singaporean self achieved here on this campus? What place and spaces exist for me to be “international”, to be Singaporean, to fundamentally be who I am, must be marked for me as “international” and “cultural”; everywhere else, assimilation is assumed, immigration is intended, erosion is expected. When I exist on this campus, I must be a part of American society, American life, American issues; no matter that my cultural issues are dismissed, because of course I’m now here in America to stay. No matter that after these four years I will return home; no matter that I bring a drastically different life, perspective, history to this campus, I must simply step here and be erased, be “American”, be a dancer to your cultural rhythms when I don’t have the first idea of what the steps are.</p>
    <p>Tufts, I love you, but for all your proclamations and activism for diversity from every part of the political spectrum, what do you care for the internationals on campus? Why am I simply co-opted as a “person of colour”, when where I come from, we are all colours? Why am I simply expected to bend to your ideology, to some kind of expected response, and not bring my own? When I talked to someone about American politics, why was my opinion about slow and steady change simply dismissed, simply brushed aside as “this isn’t how America works”? And if I do not understand America, then why the hell isn’t anyone teaching me?</p>
    <p>Why am I expected to know this the moment I step on campus, when I travelled to the other side of the world, when I left my home, my family, my friends, my food and culture and creole, and am still expected to learn, by myself, without support, your history? When you talk about diversity and inclusivity, where are the supports for the people like me, or do you only care about diversity and inclusivity when it benefits your community, aka, not us? When I come to this campus, what parts of my sky are you even willing to see?</p>
