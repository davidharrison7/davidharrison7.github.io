    <h3 class="sub-guide">Tell us a story about the gap</h3>
    <p class="guide">A gap can be about what is missing. A sense of loss, confusion, meaninglessness. What is that gap in your life? In the conversation at Tufts? In the world? How about a time when you decided to stay quiet and not fill in the gap? What was on your mind? What ended up happening?</p>
    <p class="guide">At the same time, in that empty space there is potential, there is hope, there is possibility for meaning. What will be born from there? What happened when you filled in that gap?</p>
    <p class="guide">Submission format: Anything from from 30 sec to 10 mins, (suggested length is up to 600 words) can be anything from spoken words, videos, slideshow with voice overs, as long as you will be present on stage.</p>
    <p class="guide">If you submit content that is not in written form, please explain how you envision sharing it.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-guide">Possible Themes for Submission</h3>
    <p class="guide"><i>Know Thyself:</i> What has been on your mind? Your heart? Your body? What is something that people would not be able to tell at first glance about you? What is the story of you getting to know your mind, heart and body?</p>
    <p class="guide"><i>Letter to your younger self:</i> What would you wish your freshman self to know? What life lessons have you learned along the way?</p>
    <p class="guide"><i>Struggle:</i> What struggles might you have coming into Tufts or while being here? What was the experience like? Being misunderstood? Confusion? Where are you now? Have there been small victories?</p>
    <p class="guide"><i>Change:</i> Track your own evolution or revolution. What has changed? What has not changed? What did you have to learn and unlearn?</p>
    <p class="guide"><i>Pursuit:</i> Tell us about some of your pursuits here. An idea? A person? An opportunity? Don’t forget the unexpected encounters along the way too.</p>
    <p class="guide"><i>Special Connection:</i> What about a relationship you have developed now that you never thought you would have had before coming to Tufts? What makes it so unique and what have you learned? It could be with a person, a group, an activity, an object, an idea etc… the relationship is more important than the thing itself.</p>
