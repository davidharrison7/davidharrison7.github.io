    <p class="guide">The goal of this event is to share stories from across the Tufts community that reflect experiences and perspectives that may be missing in the context of our daily lives.</p>
    <p class="guide">We hope to create a physical space where everyone feels welcome to share their story; however, we also recognize that not everyone feels comfortable in front of a group. For this reason, we have created this website as a place to view the content that has been shared at the event as well as any content the author doesnâ€™t feel that they can present.</p>
    <p class="guide">Each submission will be reviewed by a content board of Tufts students who will decide on the final grouping of submissions for the physical event. All submissions will be reviewed without names attached so that the decisions will be based purely on the content.</p>
    <p class="guide">In addition, even if a submission is not chosen for the event it will still appear on the website if you choose. This option also has the choice to remain anonymous.</p>
